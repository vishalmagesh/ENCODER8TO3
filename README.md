# ENCODER8TO3
# Aim:
To simulate and synthesis encoder using Xilinx ISE.

# Apparatus Required:
Xilinx 14.7 Spartan6 FPGA

# Procedure:
STEP:1 Start the Xilinx navigator, Select and Name the New project. STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed. STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type. STEP:4 Type the File Name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it. STEP:5 Select the Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax. STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table. STEP:7 Select the Implementation in the Sources Window and select the required file in the Processes Window. STEP:8 Select Check Syntax from the Synthesize XST Process. Double Click in the FloorplanArea/IO/Logic-Post Synthesis process in the User Constraints process group. UCF(User constraint File) is obtained. STEP:9 In the Design Object List Window, enter the pin location for each pin in the Loc column Select save from the File menu. STEP:10 Double click on the Implement Design and double click on the Generate Programming File to create a bitstream of the design.(.v) file is converted into .bit file here. STEP:11 On the board, by giving required input, the LEDs starts to glow light, indicating the output.

# Program:
```
module encoder_8 8(d,a,b,c) ;
input [7:0]d;
output a,b,c;
or(a,d[4],d[5],d[6],d[7])
or(b,d[2],d[3],d[6],d[7]);
or(c,d[1],d[3],d[5],d[7])
endmodule
```
#Output:
![313528166-658ddbd0-9643-4775-83d4-51eb1dbcec76](https://github.com/RESMIRNAIR/ENCODER8TO3/assets/160302888/b11e8bd7-a5d4-43d0-9794-e6ec046cf959)
# Result:
Hence Encoder Verified.
